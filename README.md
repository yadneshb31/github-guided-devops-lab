# GitHub Guided DevOps Lab (GGDL)

Welcome to the GitHub Guided DevOps Lab.

This repository is designed to teach DevOps fundamentals using GitHub itself as the primary learning platform.

No paid tools.
No shortcuts.
Manual first, automation later.

---

## Who This Repository Is For

- Beginners who want to learn DevOps the right way
- Engineers who want strong Git & GitHub discipline
- Anyone tired of shallow tutorials and looking for real practice

---

## How This Lab Works

This lab is **step-by-step and interactive**.

Each task is delivered as a GitHub Issue.
You are expected to:
1. Read carefully
2. Perform the task manually
3. Commit your work with discipline
4. Move forward only after understanding

Automation will be added **only after** you understand the manual process.

## Rules of Engagement

- No skipping steps
- No copy-pasting blindly
- Every commit must have meaning
- Confusion is allowed; rushing is not

---

## Getting Started

👉 Go to the **Issues** tab and start with the first issue labeled `level:0`.

Good luck. Build slowly. Build correctly.
Commit directly to main

🧠 Why This Step Is Non-Negotiable
